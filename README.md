# Hi there!

## A couple of weeks ago I didn't know what it was... :man_facepalming:
```java 
public static void main(String[] args) {
``` 
I'm diving into the depths. What will be the result?
In parallel with the training, I create the [Autosalon](https://github.com/Kngz91/Autosalon) project in which I try to apply the learned methods, commits are welcome. Let's do it! :rocket:
